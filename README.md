# CPSC110
Work from UBC CPSC110 course

Every file except for Lab 11 and Problem Set 9 recieved 100% from the autograder

Lab 11 recieved 96% because 2 autograder tests failed, despite getting full marks for test thoroughness and check-expects passing
Two seperate TAs spent roughly half an hour trying to figure out the problem and they couldn't. Theory is that there's an issue with the constant
This is to say all functions in this file work perfectly

PSet 9 recieved a 95% because there are not sufficient check expects. This is because I submitted the file 2 minutes before the deadline and didn't have time to add them
The function works perfectly though and passes all autograder tests
